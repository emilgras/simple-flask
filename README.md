# Simple Python Flask Application



This is a simple Hello World application written in Python using the popluar Flask microframework and Docker. In this description we will go through the entire process of building a simple webservice that will run on docker. This is a guide on how to re-create the Hello World application from scratch. Along the way I will provide comments to explain various topics in depth. The main purpose of this project is strictly educational - and primarily for my own experience - but is also intended to help others getting started with flask and docker applications.
